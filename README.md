# rda-owl

This is an OWL 2 version of the RDA elements and relationships, converted from the rdf/xml version at https://github.com/RDARegistry/RDA-Vocabularies, using the rda2owl converter at https://github.com/SimpleAnnoResearch/rda2owl.

## Usage

The main ontology file is rda-all.owl. It imports all the other ontologies stored in the sub folders, so all you need to do is open this file or import it from another ontology.

## Version

The current RDA version, from which these files have been converted, is **2.7.2**.
